/* EXPLANATION:
   
   XtWX represents the expected Fisher information. The overall strategy is to compute the 
   log-determinant of this matrix, to compute the adjustment factor for the likelihood (in 
   order to account for uncertainty in the nuisance parameters i.e. the fitted values).

   We want to apply the Cholesky decomposition to the XtWX matrix. However, to be safe,
   we call the routine to do a symmetric indefinite factorisation i.e. A = LDLt. This 
   guarantees factorization for singular matrices when the actual Cholesky decomposition 
   would fail because it would start whining about non-positive eigenvectors. 
  
   We then try to compute the determinant of XtWX. Here we use two facts:

   - For triangular matrices, the determinant is the product of the diagonals.
   - det(LDL*)=det(L)*det(D)*det(L*)
   - All diagonal elements of 'L' are unity.

   Thus, all we need to do is to we sum over all log'd diagonal elements in 'D', which - 
   happily enough - are stored as the diagonal elements of 'xtwx'. (And then 
   divide by two, because that's just how the Cox-Reid adjustment works.)

   'info > 0' indicates that one of the diagonals is zero. We handle this by replacing the
   it with an appropriately small non-zero value, if the diagonal element is zero or NA. This
   is valid because the zero elements correspond to all-zero columns in "WX", which in turn
   only arise when there are fitted values of zero, which will be constant at all dispersions. 
   Thus, any replacement value will eventually cancel out during interpolation to obtain the CRAPLE.

   Note that the LAPACK routine will also do some pivoting, essentially solving PAP* = LDL* for 
   some permutation matrix P. This shouldn't affect anything; the determinant of the permutation 
   is either 1 or -1, but this cancels out, so det(A) = det(PAP*).

   Further note that the routine can theoretically give block diagonals, but this should 
   not occur for positive (semi)definite matrices, which is what XtWX should always be.
